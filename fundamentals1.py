# Fundamentals task


'''Create a Python script with both single-line and multi-line comments 
explaining the purpose of the script
'''


# below code is used to perform addition operation and hash is used for single line comment
num_1=20
num_2=30
result=num_1+num_2
print(result)

'''above code is used to perform addition operation
num_1  is a variable contains a value 20
num_2 is a variable contains a value 30
addition is performed on the two variables and the result is stored in the result variable
print statement is used to display the result.
'''




'''Declare two variables, one storing an integer and the other a string. Print 
their values'''

data=100      # declaration of an integer
print(data)     # print statement is used display the data variable
sample="renuka"     #declaration of string
print(sample)       # print statement is used to display the sample variable




'''Write a program that prints a pattern using multiple print statements'''

print("*")
print("**")
print("****")
print("******")
print("*********")
print("************")
print("**************")




'''Create a Python script for a simple task and add comments to explain each 
step'''

#below code is used to perform multiplication opearion
num_3=10
num_4=40
result_1=num_3*num_4
print(result_1)


'''above code is used to perform multiplication operation
num_3 is a variable contains a value 10
num_4 is a variable contains a value 40
multiplication is performed on the variables and stored in the variable result_1
print statement is used to dispaly the result_1
'''


'''Create variables of different data types(int,float,str) and print their values'''

num_5=30        # declaration of integer
print(num_5)
num_6=7.4       # declaration of float
print(num_6)
num_7="how are you"      # declaration of string
print(num_7)



'''Determine the data type of a variable'''

discount=100        # declaration of integer
print(type(discount))




'''Display the memory addresses'''

employee_id=346
person_age=29
print(id(employee_id))  # id function is used to find the memory address of a variable
print(id(person_age))




'''Create a program that takes user age = “35ˮ, converts it to an integer, 
and then prints the result type.'''

age="35"      # declaration of string
age_1=int(age)  # int class is used to convert to int form str
print(age_1)
print(type(age_1))  # type class is used to know which datatype it is





'''Concatenate two strings and print the result'''

sample_4= "My name is Tirupathamma"    # declaration of string
sample_5=" and i am 30years old."    # declaration of string
result_2=sample_4+sample_5      # addition of two strings is called string concatenation
print(result_2)
